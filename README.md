# NoKate 

## Description 
This application is a text editing application that works from the browser. It was created using node.js, express.js, webpack, workbox, babel, and idb to build it up. The application is built to be a progressive web application (PWA) that can be downloaded and used locally as well. I have some familiarity with and use Kate as a text editor, so while in use this application is named Jate. I have also nicknamed it "NoKate" in the repository and "not-kate" when deployed. I have done this as a wordplay with the use of names such as "Sql" and "NoSql" databases. The project itself is in the same directory as this README.md file. It can be downloaded and used locally or the deployed version can be linked [here](https://not-kate-10787242895f.herokuapp.com/). Aside from being a project for learning how to develop PWAs, the application can be used as a place to jot down quick notes, code snippets, or other pieces of text that need to be temporarily written down and saved. 

## Installation 
If you wish to install the application from the GitHub repository, the only prerequisite is that you must already have Node.js installed. There are no prerequisites if it's used and installed from the deployed link above. To install locally, please follow the following steps:

1. 	Clone the directory

2.  After entering your local copy of the "NoKate" directory, run "npm install" in the terminal to install all the required dependencies.

3.  Run "npm run start" to instantiate the application. This step will automatically pull up the application in your default browser.
 

## Usage
After the application has been installed, if you close the browser, the local copy that's been created can be viewed again by going to "http://localhost:3001/". As mentioned in the description, the application is used simply by typing text into the page. It will be stored locally and will be saved even if you pull it up in another instance of your browser.

## Tests 

There have been no pre-prepared tests created for the application.
## License
The application uses an MIT license.
